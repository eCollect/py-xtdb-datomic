#TODO

* id-auto-generate in wrapper: set up objmapper._db_id_generator
  * try external-id-generator: e.g. https://github.com/sony/sonyflake
    * XXX depend on system time being monotonous, i.e. only increasing
  * try internal uuid6.uuid7 : single node
    * for multinode, overwrite some 8 bits with unique node-id (2^8=256 nodes)
      - either .uuid7 over last 8 rand_b bits , or .uuid8 over whole subsec_b (8-bit, lsb)
    * XXX probably also depend on system time being monotonous

* xtdb/v2: 
  + query-builder
  + dbclient 
  + rework rpc/dbclients: per-dbclient-specific (and not independent sym/kw/immutables)
  - transit+json : 
    + source-wise, seems slow. try speed up ?
      + few changes, some more impactful than others. broken caching
    + fix caching
    + fix UTF-8-encoding
    + fix json-stream:decode-piece-by-piece/restarting-cache
    + incremental json a.k.a "streaming-json" whitespace-delimited-multiple-top-values
    + writer is struct->str! while read/decode is ok=struct->struct
    - test speed+size with/without cache X with/without gzip, for repeating things, and for non-repeating
    - tests of transit-thing i/o as used+hacked in dbclient
  - json-LD ??

type-assurance choices: 
 -A attributes carry the type: 
    e.g. just   eav( x, :account/name, 'abc' ) alone infers x is account
    + simplest, fastest, nothing extra
    - rely on all attr-names being 2-level and correct
    - having x, no way to guess what it is
 -B id-attributes carry the type - add extra 2-clause 
        eav( x, :thing-type/id) ANDed to other filters
    e.g. .where( eav( x, :account/id),  #, infers x is account
                 eav( x, :account/name, 'abc' ), ...)
    ~ reuse available data/attr but
     - intermediate obj, needs to also have such :typename/id
    - extra 2-clause/condition per filter
    - rely on attr-name+data being correct+available (requiredness ?)
    + not rely on other attr-naming - can be any or without namespaces 
    - having x, tricky/ambiguous/no-way to guess what it is - may have multiple xxx/id
 -C special common attribute carry the type - add extra attr + 3-clause 
        eav( x, :meta/type, thing-type) ANDed to other filters
    e.g. .where( eav( x, :meta/type, 'account'),    #, infers x is account
                 eav( x, :account/name, 'abc' ), ...)
    - extra attr/data per obj
    - extra 3-clause/condition per filter
    + not rely on other attr-naming - can be any or without namespaces 
    + having x, can know what it is ; non-ambiguous
-B2 system db-id-attr carry the type    
    + no extra attr/data per obj
    - only possible in xt ; datomic always makes its own ids
    - 2 extra 3-clause/condition per filter
    - checking via pred_startswith ???
    + having x, can know what it is - the_id.split(..)[0] ; non-ambiguous

 ???? undecided
 ++?? maybe C - most clear&non-ambiguous ; non-user objects (intermediate m2m tables, separate components, etc) also needs it

attr-naming: depending on above type-assurance choices...
 >  A -> mandatory namespace=thing-type
    B -> only id has mandatory namespace=thing-type
    C -> anything ; but every obj has the special type-attr with special namespace)
 ++++ go for A: most limiting but most clear which-is-what, allows for later choice

## components are separate, hence the o2m-etc needs extra constraints (tx-funcs?) for one-ness
## as long as link/s is inside parent, it's not fully symmetric m2m, change-wise

#XXX seems anything searchable needs be separate, and only marked as "component", for auto-retrieve/delete-with-parent etc
#   mongo can index/search on inner stuff ; xtdb does not ; datomic has all separated except tuples
# history: therefore = history of entity + histories of all components-mentioned-anywhere-and-anytime

#XXX XXX XXX XXX XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
v2:  
 * has nested inner stuff - indexable and queryable.. so composites becomes usable
 * has tables i.e. explicit "types"/namespaces
 * thus it is closer to a document-db
