- objmapper.. maybe common ??
    - save:
        - update-or-create = default
        - these are possible but weak:
        -- create-no-update = match-not-exists+put
        -- update-no-create = match-exist+put
          -- with version-of-obj-optimistic-lock = match-exists-same-version+put
    - id=some-autoid-if-not-there
        - datomic: id treated as temporary, used to link objs and report real-id
        - xtdb: id is the-real-id
        see https://github.com/sony/sonyflake
    - - some future: unit-of-work, topology-sort etc
        - but for now, assume plain record/doc-based one-by-one saving.. 
    - attr-declare/processing/conversions:        
        - shema
            ? pydantic ?
        - refs
            - to-one
            - to-many


requiredness: 
 ?   transaction-function rejecting data if xyz missing

uniqueness: 
 ~  datomic: unique/ident , composite indexes etc
    xtdb: ??????? tx-func again?

type-assurance choices: 
 -A attributes carry the type: 
    e.g. just   eav( x, :account/name, 'abc' ) alone infers x is account
    + simplest, fastest, nothing extra
    - rely on all attr-names being 2-level and correct
    - having x, no way to guess what it is
 -B id-attributes carry the type - add extra 2-clause 
        eav( x, :thing-type/id) ANDed to other filters
    e.g. .where( eav( x, :account/id),  #, infers x is account
                 eav( x, :account/name, 'abc' ), ...)
    ~ reuse available data/attr but
     - intermediate obj, needs to also have such :typename/id
    - extra 2-clause/condition per filter
    - rely on attr-name+data being correct+available (requiredness ?)
    + not rely on other attr-naming - can be any or without namespaces 
    - having x, tricky/ambiguous/no-way to guess what it is - may have multiple xxx/id
 -C special common attribute carry the type - add extra attr + 3-clause 
        eav( x, :meta/type, thing-type) ANDed to other filters
    e.g. .where( eav( x, :meta/type, 'account'),    #, infers x is account
                 eav( x, :account/name, 'abc' ), ...)
    - extra attr/data per obj
    - extra 3-clause/condition per filter
    + not rely on other attr-naming - can be any or without namespaces 
    + having x, can know what it is ; non-ambiguous
-B2 system db-id-attr carry the type    
    + no extra attr/data per obj
    - only possible in xt ; datomic always makes its own ids
    - 2 extra 3-clause/condition per filter
    - checking via pred_startswith ???
    + having x, can know what it is - the_id.split(..)[0] ; non-ambiguous

 ???? undecided
 ++?? maybe C - most clear&non-ambiguous ; non-user objects (intermediate m2m tables, separate components, etc) also needs it

attr-naming: depending on above type-assurance choices...
 >  A -> mandatory namespace=thing-type
    B -> only id has mandatory namespace=thing-type
    C -> anything ; but every obj has the special type-attr with special namespace)
 ++++ go for A: most limiting but most clear which-is-what, allows for later choice

PLAIN ATTRS: text numeric=int/float/? datetime bool  enum:as-str-or-kw?  uuid:(for ids/refs)
attr-features: nullable/required  many (ordered?)  is_identity  auto-fill?
constraints: unique indexable?

RELATIONS: ref=link=pointer inside parent
features: many: o2o-o2m-m2o-m2m  separate/ component/ composite=embedded
#separate/ component/ composite-features:
#   -       +da -xt     +       auto-retrieve/delete with parent
#   +       +           -       change-independently-of-parent
#   +       +           -       search-independently-of-parent: find component-with-characteristics
#   +       +           -       parent-searchable: find-parent-which-has-component-with-characteristics

#   ~+      ~-          -       m2m
## components are separate, hence the o2m-etc needs extra constraints (tx-funcs?) for one-ness
## as long as link/s is inside parent, it's not fully symmetric m2m, change-wise

#XXX seems anything searchable needs be separate, and only marked as "component", for auto-retrieve/delete-with-parent etc
#   mongo can index/search on inner stuff ; xtdb does not ; datomic has all separated except tuples
# history: therefore = history of entity + histories of all components-mentioned-anywhere-and-anytime
